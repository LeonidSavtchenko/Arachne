A set of basic input parameters necessary for reproduction plots in the manuscript submitted to Plos

Installation. 

There are three versions of the program. Each version has its own characteristics installation.

1. The basic version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster under Linux and an executable file under  WINDOWS with GNI.

2. The second version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster under Linux and MatLab files under  WINDOWS. 

3. The third version. Open source kernel (C++) and open source local MatLab utility. 

To install Arachne:

Examples

Here are five examples showing how Arachne enables the creation and simulation of large-scale neural models.
