# Arachne
Software for the synthesis of realistic neural networks and their numerical processing on remote clusters using parallel computing. 

A set of basic input parameters necessary for reproduction plots in the manuscript submitted to Plos

Installation. 

There are three versions of the program. Each version has its own characteristics installation.



1. The basic version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster and an executable file under the window with GNI.



2. The second version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster and MatLab files. 

3. The third versionn. Open sourse kernel (C++) and open sourse local MatLab utility. 


To install Arachne:


Examples

Here are five examples showing how Arachne enables the creation and simulation of large-scale neural models.
