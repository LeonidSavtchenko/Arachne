# ARACHNE

ARACHNE is a newly designed simulation environment in which neural network organization, optimization and execution take advantage of the pre-set, optimized parallel algorithms for remote computations and friendly user interface located on a local computer. With this strategy, even amateur is able to integrate the representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve cells, within a single model in which the network complexity is limited only by the availability of remote computing resources, and not by the modelling kernel or its interface.




## Installation. 

There are 4 versions of ARACHNE. Each version has its own parameters of installation.

1. Demo-version - contains executables and the directory Core, to create and to compute networks on a cluster with a preinstalled kernel. These executables were compiled in MATLAB version 8.1.0.604 (R2013a). To run them on a local computer where this version of MATLAB is not installed (or the computer does not have any version of Matlab), user has to install corresponding version of MATLAB Runtime (R2013a). It is a free package that can be downloaded from the next webpage:    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/. The entire contents of Demo-version must be copied and installed anywhere on the local computer. To run GUI of ARACHNE the executable START_Arachne.exe must be activated. (See Manual.docx for details) 


2. MatLab version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster under Linux and MatLab files under  WINDOWS. 

3. Full version. Open source kernel (C++) and open source local MatLab utility. 

4. Android version. ARACHNE host files for OS Android.


## Examples

There are five files with initial parameters for different configurations of ARACHNE
