# ARACHNE

ARACHNE is a newly designed simulation environment in which neural network organization, optimization and execution take advantage of the pre-set, optimized parallel algorithms for remote computations and friendly user interface located on a local computer. With this strategy, even amateur is able to integrate the representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve cells, within a single model in which the network complexity is limited only by the availability of remote computing resources, and not by the modelling kernel or its interface.




## Installation. 

There are three versions of the program. Each version has its own characteristics installation.

1. The basic version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster under Linux and an executable file under  WINDOWS with GNI.

2. The second version. Pre-installed kernel in a cluster under Linux and MatLab files under  WINDOWS. 

3. The third version. Open source kernel (C++) and open source local MatLab utility. 

## Examples

There are five files with initial parameters for different configurations of ARACHNE
