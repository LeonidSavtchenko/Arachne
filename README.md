# ARACHNE

## version 2.0
## Update is expected to be released at 01.04.2017



ARACHNE is a newly designed simulation environment in which neural and neuroglial network organisation, optimisation and execution take advantage of the pre-set, optimised parallel algorithms for remote computations, and of a friendly user interface located on a local computer. In these settings, a neuroscientist without IT background should be able to incorporate the representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve (or astroglial) cells, within a single network model in which the network complexity is limited only by the availability of remote computing resources, and not by the modelling kernel or its interface.






## Installation. 

### There are 4 versions of ARACHNE. Each version has its own parameters of installation.

1. "Demo-version" - contains executables and the directory "Core", to create and to compute networks on a cluster with preinstalled kernel. These executables were compiled in MATLAB version 8.1.0.604 (R2013a). To run the demo on a local computer where this version of MATLAB is not installed (or the computer does not have any version of Matlab), a user has to install corresponding version of MATLAB Runtime (R2013a). It is a free package that can be downloaded from the  webpage:    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/. The entire contents of Demo-version must be copied and installed anywhere on the local computer. To run GUI of ARACHNE the executable file START_Arachne.exe must be launched. (See Manual.docx for details) 


2.	"Full-version" contains two directories  "host" and "worker"  for installation ARACHNE in any cluster operating under Linux/Windows and any host computer operating under Windows with preinstalled Matlab. 

3.	"Matlab-version" contains only "host" files with MatLab codes and the bat-files that control the communication between host computers and the preinstalled cluster. This catalogue can be downloaded at any place of "host" computer operating under Windows. The file Readme.md has a detail instruction about a set of steps of working with the soft. 

4. "Mobile-version" contains files for the mobile device operating under Mobile OS.
