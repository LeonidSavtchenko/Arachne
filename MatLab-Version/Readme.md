In this configuration, Matlab files can be changed, except with the Cluster Management folder /host/code

How to work. 

Upload files from this folder to any location on your computer running under Windows. 

Find file START_GammaSimulator.m and run this file  in MatLab environment. After checking cluster
you can be able to choose the single option from three

1. Download "output.mat" and analyse results.
2. Start simulation from scratch (current files "output.mat" and "intermediate.mat" will be lost).
3. Continue simulation from the same point.

[1, 2 or 3]: 

The program will offer the parametric table. Using these options you can change the parameters as you wish, creating a new network model.

You can save this set and use it for the next computation. 

press OK

If the program is set  up on the network memory, the program will ask you to specify the input pattern to remember. If you do not want to create a pattern, then press Draw with MatLab. In the following table do not activate any keys and simply click OK.
